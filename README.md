Revert to the previous version of Office

Follow these steps to revert to the previous version of Office.


Set a reminder to enable automatic updates at a future date


Install the previous version of Office

To install the previous version of Office, follow these steps:

    Determine and note the previous version number. Use the following Microsoft website to find the update version that is previous to the current version:

    Update history for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise (listed by date)

    Download and run the self-extracting executable file which contains the Office Deployment Tool executable (Setup.exe) and a sample configuration file (Configuration.xml):

    Office Deployment Tool (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49117)

    Start Notepad and copy the following XML. Then, save the file as Config.xml in the same file location as the Setup.exe file from Step 2.

    <Configuration>
    <Updates Enabled="TRUE" TargetVersion="16.0.xxxxx.yyyyy" />
    </Configuration>


    Note In the XML, 16.0.xxxxx.yyyyy represents the full version number


    Open an elevated Command Prompt window. To do this, click Start, type cmd in the Start Search box, right-click cmd.exe, and then click Run as administrator. Switch to the file location for the Setup.exe and Config.xml files.

    Run the following command:

    setup.exe /configure config.xml

    Start an Office application (such as Excel), and then select File > Account.

    In the Product Information section, select Update Options > Update Now. 

    Note If you are prompted to activate Office again, enter your Microsoft account and password. This step does not add your computer to your account a second time.

Step 3: Disable automatic updates for Office

This step is very important. Office automatically checks for updates on a regular basis. To prevent Office from automatically installing new updates, follow these steps:

    Start Outlook.

    Click File, and then click Office Account.

    In the Product Information column, click Update Options, and then click Disable Updates.
