# Downgradeing-O365-for-Exploit-Testing
This guide will walk though how to downgrade O365 in order for exploit testing


To install the previous version of Office, follow these steps:

    Determine and note the previous version number. Use the following Microsoft website to find the update version that is previous to the current version:

  

    Download and run the self-extracting executable file using the Office Deployment Tool executable (Setup.exe) and a sample configuration file (Configuration.xml), which is located below. 


    Start Notepad and copy the following XML. Then, save the file as Config.xml in the same file location as the Setup.exe file from Step 2.

    <Configuration>
    <Updates Enabled="TRUE" TargetVersion="16.0.xxxxx.yyyyy" />
    </Configuration>


    Note In the XML, 16.0.xxxxx.yyyyy represents the full version number that you noted in step 1.
    Note for the XML, See Code base attached.

    Open an elevated Command Prompt window. To do this, click Start, type cmd in the Start Search box, right-click cmd.exe, and then click Run as administrator. Switch to the file location for the Setup.exe and Config.xml files.

    Run the following command:

    setup.exe /configure config.xml

    Start an Office application (such as Word), and then select File > Account.

    In the Product Information section, select Update Options > Update Now. 

    Note If you are prompted to activate Office again, enter your Microsoft account and password. This step does not add your computer to your account a second time.

Step 3: Disable automatic updates for Office

This step is very important. Office automatically checks for updates on a regular basis. To prevent Office from automatically installing new updates, follow these steps:

    Start Outlook.

    Click File, and then click Office Account.

    In the Product Information column, click Update Options, and then click Disable Updates.
